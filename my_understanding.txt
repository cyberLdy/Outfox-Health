PART1 :

Build a fastapi backend system support async request for 
/get endpoint and we want it non-blocking, of course.

GET /providers?drg=470&zip=10001&radius_km=40


where it have 3 parameter on the request
and
it means:
List of hospitals with knee replacement procedures, sorted by cost

drg zip radius_km


first, let's take a look DRG , DRG = Diagnosis-Related Group

after reading the csv file, I am assuiming we need :
DRG_Cd	DRG_Desc from csv, it represent the number(code) and the description of that procedure
 
ok good,
Next
zip, so we need zip  radius_km, ok it's the same thing, so we need to list each hospital zip, and for better 
display we just list all the info, let's building first one.

so provider:
Rndrng_Prvdr_CCN	Rndrng_Prvdr_Org_Name	Rndrng_Prvdr_City Rndrng_Prvdr_St,Rndrng_Prvdr_Zip5	Rndrng_Prvdr_State_Abrvtn
hospital code, hospital name, hospital city, hospital address, hospital zipcode, hospital state


ok since we do the radius_km, maybe we can just use zipcode insted of the actual address,

so building a table of provider, the hospital info,
we just use provider_id, name, city, state, zipcode. it's good enough


ok, then for each hospital, we build another table, that's for what procedure is this hospital provide, and
their each payment info

so procedures table
provider id, drg code, drg_desc, 
ok and it sort by cost, 
which one, lets take a look sorted by average_covered_charges
ok, so it must add there,

but wait, we maybe need total_discharges and all other info to do the ratings? it's valueable.


ok, now it's clear,

panda reads the csv, extract the column, build tabels on supabase, build tabels for first request

REST API endpoints:
GET /providers - Search hospitals by DRG, ZIP code, and radius_km
Returns hospitals sorted by average_covered_charges
Implements DRG description matching using ILIKE or fuzzy search
