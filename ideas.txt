Reflections on LLM Querying and Data Structure
The current task focuses on structured data (hospital pricing in CSV format) and aims to enable natural language (NL) to SQL translation using LLMs. This is well-suited for:

Tabular data

Clear schema (e.g., DRG codes, ZIP codes, ratings)

Reliable results via SQL-based grounding


However, in real-world scenarios, unstructured data (like PDFs, medical guidelines, or clinical notes) is often more common and challenging. These cases would typically require:

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines

Vector databases for semantic search

More complex parsing and grounding mechanisms

That said, this exercise intentionally avoids RAG to test LLM-driven SQL generation, which is appropriate given the structured dataset and MVP scope.

✅ Conclusion: For structured data, SQL + OpenAI is sufficient and robust.
⚠️ For unstructured data, LLMs would need vector search and RAG to perform reliably.
