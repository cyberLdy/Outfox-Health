Problem: ZIP Radius Filtering for /providers
We needed to support filtering hospitals within a given radius of a ZIP code. This required geocoding (ZIP → lat/lon) and distance calculation.

❌ Attempt 1: Nominatim API (geopy)
Frequent timeouts and HTTP 429 errors

Not suitable for bulk ETL or real-time queries
→ Rejected due to rate limits

❌ Attempt 2: PostGIS in PostgreSQL
Ideal for geospatial queries (e.g. ST_DistanceSphere)

Supabase doesn't support PostGIS in shared/free-tier
→ Rejected due to platform limitations

✅ Final: SimpleMaps ZIP Dataset
Used SimpleMaps free ZIP → lat/lon CSV

Joined coordinates in ETL

Stored lat/lon in provider records

Used geopy.distance.geodesic() at runtime for filtering

Trade-offs
Method	Pros	Cons
Nominatim	Easy to use	Rate-limited, unreliable
PostGIS	SQL-native, scalable	Not available on Supabase
SimpleMaps ✅	Fast, offline, free	Slight inaccuracy possible

Conclusion: SimpleMaps + Python was the best cost-free, offline solution under Supabase constraints.



the grounding on the response:

first:

{'answer': 'The cheapest hospital is Cambridge Health Alliance in Cambridge, MA with an average covered charge of $17,785.20', 'sql_query': "SELECT providers.name, providers.city, providers.state, procedures.avg_covered_charges \nFROM providers \nJOIN procedures ON providers.provider_id = procedures.provider_id \nWHERE procedures.drg_code = '470' \nORDER BY procedures.avg_covered_charges ASC LIMIT 1;"}


The issue is that the AI sometimes adds LIMIT 1 and sometimes doesn't. 
Also, our answer formatting isn't smart enough. Let's fix both issues.

===== Test 1: What's the cheapest hospital for knee replacement? =====
{'answer': 'Found 1371 results. Here are the details:\n- Cambridge Health Alliance in Cambridge, MA\n- Beverly Hospital Corporation in Beverly, MA\n- West Calcasieu Cameron Hospital in Sulphur, LA\n- Excela Health Westmoreland Hospital in Greensburg, PA\n- Tidalhealth Peninsula Regional, Inc in Salisbury, MD\n', 'sql_query': "SELECT p.name, p.city, p.state, proc.avg_covered_charges \nFROM providers p \nJOIN procedures proc ON p.provider_id = proc.provider_id \nWHERE proc.drg_code = '470' \nORDER BY proc.avg_covered_charges ASC;"}

===== Test 2: Which hospitals have the best ratings for knee replacement? =====
{'answer': 'Found 1371 results. Here are the details:\n- Prisma Health  Patewood Hospital in Greenville, SC\n- Beckley Arh Hospital in Beckley, WV\n- Steward North Shore Medical Center in Miami, FL\n- Halifax Health Medical Center in Daytona Beach, FL\n- Staten Island University Hospital in Staten Island, NY\n', 'sql_query': "SELECT p.name, p.city, p.state, r.rating \nFROM providers p\nJOIN procedures pr ON p.provider_id = pr.provider_id\nJOIN ratings r ON p.provider_id = r.provider_id\nWHERE pr.drg_code = 
'470'\nORDER BY r.rating DESC;"}
