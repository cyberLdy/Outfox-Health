📌 Reflections on LLM Querying and Structured Data
🎯 Task Context
This project centers around translating natural language questions into SQL queries to interact with structured hospital pricing and rating data.

It’s a great fit for:

✅ Tabular data from standardized CSV files

✅ Defined schema with fields like DRG codes, ZIP codes, cost, and ratings

✅ Reliable outputs thanks to SQL-based grounding and constraints

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o perform well under these conditions, especially when paired with:

Well-scoped prompts

Schema-aware instructions

Format-constrained outputs (e.g., SQL + JSON)

🧠 Real-World Limitations
While the current MVP works well for structured data, real-world healthcare data often looks very different:

Data Type	Example Sources	Challenge
Unstructured	Medical guidelines, PDFs, EHR free-text	Needs parsing + interpretation
Semi-structured	Clinical notes, discharge summaries	Context-heavy, ambiguous

To handle this, real systems typically require:

🔎 RAG pipelines (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to inject grounding context

📚 Vector DBs (FAISS, Chroma, Weaviate) for semantic similarity

🧾 Advanced NLP techniques to parse clinical language and normalize fields

✅ Conclusion
Data Type	Best Approach
Structured data	SQL + LLM (prompt-based querying) ✅
Unstructured data	RAG + semantic search 🔍

The MVP's LLM+SQL pattern is fast, lightweight, and effective — perfect for cost/rating search using tabular inputs.

🚀 Future Improvement Ideas
Although not critical for the MVP, these ideas could significantly enhance user experience and robustness:

Direction	Description
🔍 Fuzzy DRG Search	Support typos or vague terms like “knee replace” → DRG 470 (via fuzzy search or mapping)
📍 Natural Language Location	Understand "within 20 km of 10001" or "near Los Angeles" and map to ZIP+radius
📊 Chart/Structured Output	Return JSON formatted for charts to enable front-end visualizations (bar/line)
